Implementation Plan: Historical Figure Narrative Game
Project Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of a text-based interactive narrative game where users can experience life through the eyes of famous historical figures or create custom characters. The app uses AI-generated narratives and focuses on choice-based gameplay with historically accurate or creative storylines.

Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)

 Project setup with Expo and React Native
 Character selection screen
 Basic narrative screen with static content
 Local storage for game state
 Character creation UI

Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 3-4)

 Integrate Hugging Face or GPT4All
 Create prompt engineering system
 Implement narrative generation service
 Add fallback to pre-written content

Phase 3: Character Library (Weeks 5-6)

 Create database of historical figures
 Add historical events for each figure
 Implement character trait system
 Add historically accurate vs. creative paths

Phase 4: User Experience & Polish (Weeks 7-8)

 Add animations and transitions
 Implement sound effects/haptics
 Create story saving/loading system
 Add settings and customization options

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Weeks 9-10)

 User testing and feedback
 Bug fixes and performance optimization
 Prepare for app store submission
 Documentation and support materials

Technical Implementation Notes
AI Prompt Engineering
To generate high-quality, contextually appropriate narratives:

Historical Context Prompts
CopyGenerate a narrative scene for {character_name} in {year} at {location}.
Historical context: {key_events_happening}
Character traits: {traits}
Previous choices: {previous_choices}
The narrative should be {accuracy_level} historically accurate.

Response Format
Structure all AI responses in consistent JSON format:
jsonCopy{
  "narrative": [
    {"type": "narration", "text": "..."},
    {"type": "dialogue", "speaker": "Character Name", "text": "..."},
    {"type": "historical-fact", "text": "..."}
  ],
  "choices": [
    {"id": "choice1", "text": "...", "impact": "...", "historicalAccuracy": "accurate"},
    {"id": "choice2", "text": "...", "impact": "...", "historicalAccuracy": "creative"}
  ]
}


Offline Functionality
To handle offline scenarios or API limitations:

Pre-written Content

Create a library of fallback narratives for key historical figures
Implement branching based on common choice patterns


Local AI

Option to download GPT4All for offline generation
Smaller model with fewer parameters for mobile devices



Performance Optimization
To ensure smooth experience on mobile devices:

Lazy Loading

Load historical data only when needed
Use pagination for character browsing


Caching

Cache AI responses for similar prompts
Store generated narratives for reuse



Monetization Potential (Future)
While focusing on free development now, future monetization could include:

Premium Characters

Additional historical figures with detailed storylines
Special character packs (e.g., Scientists, Artists, Leaders)


Enhanced AI

Higher-quality generation with premium API
More complex branching narratives


Story Exports

Export completed stories as ebooks or PDFs
Share stories with social features


Custom Artwork

Character portraits and scene illustrations
Visual novel style presentation option
